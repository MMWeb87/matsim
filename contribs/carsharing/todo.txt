Report: 
- Introduction paper (Marc: EV, Elyas carsharing)

Programming
- Manager: reserves vehicles and reserves parking.
- Implement in reservesVehicles function a check if the car can be rented (depends on charge)
 	- add variable rejection rate (write to variable) 
- Add ranges to EV vehicles (Marc)
- Add hasChargingPoint, voltage attribute to station. (Elyas) -> don't care about voltage, related to charging time parameter 

Data Preparation
- Put stations on map 
- Populate with people


Figure out where to implement
- fleetsize?
- charging speed (depends ond car and voltage)
- config file.
- how to choice where the charging stations are.


Decisions:
- which cars to use
- charging speed
